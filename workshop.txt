title=[B42] Buildables Expansion
description=[i]A continuation of my popular [b]Building Menu[/b] mod - rebuilt for Build 42 with new content, new systems, and expanded possibilities.[/i]

description=[h2]What Is This Mod?[/h2]
description=This mod expands on the vanilla build menu introduced by the developers in Build 42. It continues the legacy of my original [b]Building Menu[/b] mod - which pioneered a custom UI for building before the devs added one to the base game.
description=
description=[b]Buildables Expansion[/b] picks up where that mod left off, adding dozens of immersive and lore-friendly buildables not included in vanilla. It extends your crafting freedom with [b]furniture, appliances, stairs, fences, floors, lighting, windows, and more[/b] - all with a focus on realism and depth.

description=[h2]Unlock Buildables Through Discovery[/h2]
description=Choose how your character learns to build. [b]Three unlocking styles[/b] are available via sandbox options:
description=[list]
description=[*][b]Learned + Sketched (Combined):[/b] Find [i]vintage magazines[/i] [b]or[/b] [i]sketch real objects[/i] in the world using your Builder's Sketchbook
description=[*][b]Magazine Only:[/b] Unlock new items exclusively by reading lore-based magazines like [i]Fine Wood Working[/i], [i]The Family Handyman[/i], [i]Popular Mechanics[/i] and more
description=[*][b]Sketchbook Only:[/b] Using the [b]Builder's Sketchbook[/b] by researching items in the world and sketching them manually
description=[/list]
description=
description=Magazines are lootable, limited, and tied to specific buildable groups. The sketchbook offers a hands-on alternative - find the object, examine it, draw it, build it.

description=
description=[b]The Builder's Sketchbook[/b] is crafted with a notebook and pen, and allows you to sketch world objects as you find them.
description=[u]Sketching does not allow you to build directly from the sketchbook[/u]; instead, [b]it unlocks those buildables inside the standard build menu[/b] as long as you are carrying the sketchbook where the sketch for the object was drawn.

description=[h2]Lore-Driven Learning[/h2]
description=Buildables Expansion introduces a system where crafting knowledge comes from [b]discovery[/b], not from the start.
description=
description=Find 1980s and 90s-era magazines such as [i]Home Mechanix, Fine Wood Working, Architectural Digest[/i], and more. Or, draw objects yourself using the [b]Builder's Sketchbook[/b].
